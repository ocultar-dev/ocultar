# OCULTAR | PII Detection & Compliance Glossary

This document provides a transparency disclosure of the PII types detected by the OCULTAR Refinery and their respective regulatory compliance mappings.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **EU Sovereign Detection Pack (v1)** is now active. This pack provides deterministic coverage and checksum-backed validation for core EU and UK identifiers, satisfying GDPR Art. 9 and local sovereignty requirements (CNIL, AEPD, BDSG).

## 1. Detection Tiers

The Refinery operates on a multi-tier defense-in-depth model:

| Tier | Name | Methodology | `method` tag |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tier 0.1** | Base64 Evasion Shield | Decodes and recursively scans every Base64 segment in the payload. PII hidden inside encoded blobs is caught and re-encoded after redaction — the payload structure is preserved, the data is not. | *(inherits inner tier's tag)* |
| **Tier 0** | Dictionary Shield | Exact match against VIP and exclusion lists from `configs/protected_entities.json`. | `"dictionary"` |
| **Tier 1** | Deterministic Registry | High-performance Go regular expressions with **checksum-backed validation** (Luhn mod-10 for credit cards, MOD97 for IBANs, and 12 national ID validators). Pattern matches that fail their checksum are discarded rather than flagged — eliminating false positives at the source. | `"regex"` or `["regex","checksum"]` |
| **Tier 1.1** | Phone Shield | libphonenumber validation for international and localized formats. Runs after Tier 1 to avoid misidentifying digit sequences already claimed by national IDs. | `"phone"` |
| **Tier 1.2** | Address Shield | Heuristic street address parser supporting EN/FR/ES/DE formats. | `"address"` |
| **Tier 1.5** | Greeting/Signature Shield | Extracts names from salutations (`"Regards, Jean"`) and self-introductions (`"My name is..."`). | `"greeting"` |
| **Tier 2** | AI Semantic Scan | Contextual NER via a pluggable Python sidecar. Default model: `openai/privacy-filter` (bidirectional token classifier, Apache 2.0). `piiranha-v1` is supported as a multilingual alternative for mixed-language corpora. Activated via `TIER2_ENGINE=privacy-filter` and `--profile ai` in Docker Compose. | `"ai-ner"` |
| **Tier 3** | Structural Heuristics | Context-aware proximity rules and entity expansion (professional titles, possessives, conjunction linkage). | `"structural"` |

The `method` tag appears in each `DetectionResult.method` field returned by `/api/refine` and displayed in the **Detection Attribution** panel of the dashboard. It tells you exactly which pipeline tier caught each entity.

## 3. Canonical InfoType Mapping (Google Cloud DLP)

For enterprise compliance parity, OCULTAR internal types are mapped to **Google Cloud InfoTypes**. This registry is visible in the Operational Dashboard and available via `/api/config/mapping`.

| Ocultar ID | Google InfoType Equivalent |
|---|---|
| `EMAIL` | `EMAIL_ADDRESS` |
| `SSN` | `US_SOCIAL_SECURITY_NUMBER` |
| `IBAN` | `IBAN_CODE` |
| `CREDIT_CARD` | `CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER` |
| `IP_ADDRESS` | `IP_ADDRESS` |
| `LOCATION` | `LOCATION` |
| ... | (Full list of 30+ mappings in Registry) |

## 4. Redaction Behavior

OCULTAR uses **deterministic pseudonymization** via two complementary token paths:

- **Same Input = Same Token (hash path)**: For structural identifiers (EMAIL, SSN, PHONE, IBAN, etc.), the token is `[TYPE_sha256[:8]]`. The same value always produces the same token — across requests, sessions, and documents. Relational integrity is fully preserved in tokenized datasets.
- **Canonical entity tokens (registry path)**: For PERSON-class entities registered in the Entity Registry, all known name variants (`"John"`, `"Doe"`, `"John Doe"`, `"J. Doe"`) resolve to a single **numeric token** (`[PERSON_1]`). This prevents token fragmentation — two mentions of the same person in the same document always receive the same token even if the name appears in different forms.
- **Irreversible without the Vault**: Hash tokens contain no original data. Reversal requires both the **Identity Vault** (DuckDB/PostgreSQL) and the **Master Key** — neither of which ever leaves your infrastructure. Entity tokens rehydrate directly from `canonical_name` in the `canonical_entities` table — no decryption needed.

### Entity Registry

The Entity Registry (`services/vault/entity_registry.go`) is a persistent, session-spanning identity layer:

- Pre-seed known identities (patients, employees, contacts) via `POST /v1/entities` or `POST /v1/entities/seed` on the Sombra gateway.
- All name variants map to a single canonical token: `[PERSON_1]`, `[PERSON_2]`, etc.
- The refinery checks `entity_variants` before the HMAC-SHA256 hash path for any `PERSON`, `PERSON_VIP`, `HEALTH_ENTITY`, `PROTECTED_ENTITY`, or `ORGANIZATION` match.
- Numeric-suffix tokens (`[PERSON_1]`) rehydrate via `GetEntityByToken` — bypassing AES decryption. Hash-suffix tokens (`[PERSON_8d9c1b15]`) follow the standard AES path.
- Seeding is idempotent and safe to re-run. See the [Entity Registry Guide](../guides/ENTITY_REGISTRY_GUIDE.md) for full API documentation.

### Privacy-Safe Analytics on Tokenized Data

Because tokens are deterministic, **you can perform aggregations, joins, and frequency analysis directly on tokenized data — without ever de-tokenizing it.**

A dataset where every email has been replaced with `[EMAIL_9c8f7a1b]` still supports:
- **Counting unique users** — distinct token values = distinct PII values
- **Joining across tables** — the same person appears with the same token in every table
- **Frequency analysis** — which customers appear most often, without exposing who they are
- **Anomaly detection** — token-level clustering and outlier detection on sensitive fields

Re-hydration to plaintext is only required when a human must read a specific value. All analytical workloads can remain in the tokenized domain. This property is a direct consequence of the HMAC-SHA256-based token design in `getOrSetSecureResult` (`services/refinery/pkg/refinery/refinery.go`) and requires no additional configuration.

## 5. Auditor Verification Note

Every policy update in OCULTAR goes through the **Validation-First DAG**:
1.  **Simulation**: Proposed changes are replayed against the last 1,000 requests to predict impact.
2.  **Signing**: Final policies are signed with Ed25519 to prevent tampering.
3.  **Audit**: The `compliance-integrity-suite` continuously monitors for configuration drift and runtime violations.

## 6. Performance & SLA

The Tier 2 AI Scan implements deterministic SLA enforcement:
- **Thirty-Second Timeout**: Every AI scan is bounded by a strict 30-second `http.Client` timeout (hardcoded in `inference/remote.go`). Configurable at the application level via `inference_timeout` in `config.yaml` (currently advisory only).
- **Fail-Closed Strategy**: If the scan exceeds this budget or the sidecar is unreachable, the request fails with a security error, preventing un-scanned data from being processed.
- **Session Cache**: Results are stored in a thread-safe `sync.Map` keyed by the original input string. Repeat scans within the same request session are sub-millisecond and bypass the network.
- **Single-Pass Batch Scan**: For complex JSON records, the SLM is called once per record (not per string field) to reduce round-trips and preserve relational token integrity.
