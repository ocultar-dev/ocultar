# OCULTAR | Product Context

This document provides a deep, technical, and conceptual overview of the OCULTAR ecosystem. It outlines the core principles of **Zero-Egress security**, **PII refinement**, and **regulatory compliance** that guide every design decision.

## 1. Product Mission

OCULTAR is an open-source **Global Data Refinery**. Its mission is to enable safe AI adoption and infrastructure-level compliance by intercepting, refining, and monitoring all data flows—from HTTP to Syslog—converting regulatory liabilities into audit-safe assets.

## 2. Core Components

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| **Privacy Proxy** | The primary interface (transparent HTTP proxy) that intercepts AI payloads and enforces redaction/re-hydration. |
| **Live Refinery** | The multi-tier engine (Base64 Shield, Regex Registry, NLP, SLM) that detects and tokenizes PII in real-time. |
| **Identity Vault** | A local, encrypted database (DuckDB/PostgreSQL) that stores mappings for deterministic re-hydration. |
| **SLM Sidecar** | A high-performance inference engine for local AI-based PII detection (NER). |
| **Sombra Gateway** | An advanced agentic gateway (external sibling) that adds multi-model routing and orchestrated query capabilities. |
| **Governance & Audit** | Immutable Ed25519-signed audit log and SIEM-ready logging for all PII lifecycle events. |

## 3. Fundamental Principles

- **Zero-Egress**: Sensitive data never leaves your infrastructure. Only non-sensitive tokens are sent to external LLM providers.
- **Fail-Closed**: If a security check fails or an error occurs, the system defaults to blocking the request to prevent accidental leakage.
- **Privacy-by-Design**: User anonymity is preserved through robust, deterministic pseudonymization.
- **Regulatory Alignment**: Every interaction is mapped to specific regulatory articles (e.g., **GDPR**, **HIPAA**, **SOC 2 Type II**, **PCI DSS v4.0**, **NIS2**, **EU AI Act**, **BSI C5**) for automated compliance auditing.
- **Specialized Vision (SR-SLM)**: Intelligence is focused on high-precision entity recognition (data "eyes") while software controls the logic.

## 4. Target Users

- **CISO & Compliance Officers**: Monitor the Risk Matrix and ensure data privacy standards are met.
- **IT / DevOps**: Deploy and maintain the OCULTAR/Sombra infrastructure.
- **App Developers**: Seamlessly integrate applications with safe AI via the Sombra Gateway.
- **Security Teams**: Validate detection coverage and audit redaction events.

## 5. Security Goals

- **No Secret Leakage**: Credentials and internal paths are never included in distributions.
- **Evasion-Proof**: The Refinery is hardened against Base64 or URL-encoding obfuscation attacks.
- **Immutable Audit**: Logs are tamper-proof and provide a clear regulatory trail.
